## Basic work flow:
  
  First time set up
  
    $  git clone https://github.com/jaideng123/315-DBMS-Project.git
    
  Before you start working on anything
  
    write what you are working on in the development log
     $  git pull
    
  Once you've finished working on something
  
    write that you finished it in the development log
    $  git pull
    $  git add .
    $  git commit -m "title of commit goes here"
    $  git push
